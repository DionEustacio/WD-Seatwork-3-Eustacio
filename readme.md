## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Header and Footer
- This project is an interactive website showcasing various header and footer designs created using pure HTML and CSS. It allows users to explore different static and animated header and footer styles through a user-friendly interface.
- Key Elements
Header: Displays the website title and a short description.
Main Content: Provides an explanation of the project's purpose and introduces the user to the gallery sections.
Button Panel: Contains buttons for each gallery section (e.g., "Header Gallery," "Footer Gallery").
Gallery Sections: Each section displays various header or footer designs. They are initially hidden and become visible upon clicking the corresponding button.
Design Links: Each design within a gallery section is represented by a link with a descriptive text, allowing users to potentially explore the HTML/CSS code behind the design (depending on your implementation).
- Technology Used:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Forms the structure and content of the webpage, including headings, paragraphs, buttons, and links.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Defines the visual presentation of the webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness (how the page adapts to different screen sizes).
JavaScript (Optional): Adds interactivity to the webpage. In this case, JavaScript is used to:
Detect button clicks.
Identify the target gallery section based on the clicked button.
Display the corresponding gallery section by changing its display property.
- How Technology is Used:
HTML:
Creates the overall webpage structure.
Defines headings, paragraphs, buttons, and links for navigation.
Structures the header, main content, button panel, and gallery sections using appropriate HTML tags.
CSS:
Styles the visual appearance of the webpage elements (header, buttons, gallery sections).
Defines colors, fonts, spacing, and layout for a visually appealing presentation.
JavaScript (Optional):
Listens for user interaction (clicking buttons).
When a button is clicked, JavaScript retrieves the ID of the target gallery section based on the button's data attribute.
It then manipulates the target section's display property (changing it from none to block), making it visible to the user.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
